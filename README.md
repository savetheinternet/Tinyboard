vichan - A lightweight and full featured PHP imageboard.
========================================================

**Please do not contact Fredrick Brennan in regards to vichan issues.**

As of 29 August 2022 it supports PHP8.1.

About
------------
vichan is a free light-weight, fast, highly configurable and user-friendly
imageboard software package. It is written in PHP and has few dependencies.

Some documentation may be found on our [wiki](https://github.com/vichan-devel/vichan/wiki). (feel free to contribute)

History
------------
vichan is a fork of (now defunc'd) [Tinyboard](http://github.com/savetheinternet/Tinyboard),
a great imageboard package, actively building on it and adding a lot of features and other
improvements.

Upgrade
-------
To upgrade from any version of Tinyboard or vichan:

Either run ```git pull``` to update your files, if you used git, or
backup your ```inc/instance-config.php```, replace all your files in place
(don't remove boards etc.), then put ```inc/instance-config.php``` back and
finally run ```install.php```.

To migrate from a Kusaba X board, use http://github.com/vichan-devel/Tinyboard-Migration

Demo
--------
Demo with the most updated version of [Vichan](https://vichan.27chan.org).

1. PHP 8.1
2. MySQL 5.7
3. KeyDB 6.2.1 (Redis)
4. NGINX 1.14.0

Support
--------
vichan is still beta software -- there are bound to be bugs. If you find a
bug, please report it.

CLI tools
-----------------
There are a few command line interface tools, based on Tinyboard-Tools. These need
to be launched from a Unix shell account (SSH, or something). They are located in a ```tools/```
directory.

You actually don't need these tools for your imageboard functioning, they are aimed
at the power users. You won't be able to run these from shared hosting accounts
(i.e. all free web servers).

Oekaki
------
vichan makes use of [wPaint](https://github.com/websanova/wPaint) for oekaki. After you pull the repository, however, you will need to download wPaint separately using git's `submodule` feature. Use the following commands:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

To enable oekaki, add all the scripts listed in `js/wpaint.js` to your `instance-config.php`.

WebM support
------------
Read `inc/lib/webm/README.md` for information about enabling webm.

vichan API
----------
vichan provides by default a 4chan-compatible JSON API. For documentation on this, see:
https://github.com/vichan-devel/vichan-API/ .

--------
